	<h1>Sound Examples</h1>

	<p>This is the companion website of the book chapter "Leveraging Online Audio Commons Content For Media Production" (2018)
	by Anna Xambó, Frederic Font, György Fazekas, and Mathieu Barthet, which appears in XX (ed.) <em>Foundations in Sound Design for Linear Media: an interdisciplinary approach</em>.</p>

	<h2>Soundscape Composition</h2>

	<p>We provide here examples of short soundscape compositions that have been created in the fall of 2017 by students from the Sound Recording and Production Techniques module at Queen Mary University of London led by Mathieu Barthet. The soundscape themes were found by applying and adapting the participatory design technique described in (Holmquist, 2008). Students were invited to generate ideas across four categories: character, place/environment, situation/action, and mood. These ideas were combined randomly and formed the basis of soundscape themes after a reflection and simplification phase. Students were given the creative constraint of only using sounds sourced from Audio Commons or Apple Loops. They could edit and process the sounds in the DAW and were able to use AudioGaming’s AudioTexture plugin to generate novel sonic textures from Audio Commons audio content.</p>

	<h3>Example 1 - Submerged by Andrew Thompson</h3>

		<p>Abstract: The piece, titled Submerged, is a short narrative that follows someone under immense pressure as they are plunged underwater in their dreams. Audio content in the composition was sourced either from Freesound.org or from the Apple Loops library and chosen to either directly reinforce the core concept or work to better realise the sonic space. Audio processing such as pitch shifting and chorus were applied, and mixing techniques such as utilising the Haas effect and binaural processing to provide space, clarity, and interest in the mix.	</p>

	<h3>Example 2 - “Space meal” by Andrea Guidi</h3>

	<p>Abstract: A woman doctor is in a rush and rapidly shares a meal in the space with a friend. She is so busy that she cannot relax and her smart devices continuously spread alerts
	concerning her work and less important things. In this context, her friend’s complaints
	do not receive much consideration. Thus, a metaphoric conversation between the
	woman doctor, her friend and her smart devices (through the sound alerts) happens
	during the soundscape. The doctor’s attention is overloaded both by notifications and
	by her friends complaints while the listener auditory experience is overloaded by the
	amplitude and presence of the sounds that describe the meal (cutleries and chewing).</p>

	<h3>Example 3 - “A camper and his dog in France” by Caryl Jones</h3>

	<p>Abstract: The resources for this composition solely included recorded sounds from Freesound, the concatenative synthesis plugin AudioTexture to treat some of these sounds and audio samples from Apple Loops. The digital audio workstation (DAW) used was Logic and Audio Technica headphones for monitoring. The compositional approach was to create a figurative piece with an abstract, dream-like edge of a man walking his dog in France from a first person perspective. Sounds were divided into five categories for the arrangement and laid out in a linear way to tell a story from morning to evening with quick transitions between natural summer scenes. Sounds were arranged and mixed using trim, volume, pan automation, gain and EQ. The composition was mastered using a limiter to stop clipping.</p>
