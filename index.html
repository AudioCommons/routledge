	<title>Designing Sounds With The Cloud Companion Website</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>Sound Examples</h1>

	<p>This is the companion website of the book chapter "Leveraging Online Audio Commons Content For Media Production" (2018)
	by Anna Xambó, Frederic Font, György Fazekas, and Mathieu Barthet, which appears in Michael Filimowicz (ed.) <em>Foundations in Sound Design for Linear Media: an interdisciplinary approach</em>, Routledge.</p>

	<h2>AudioTexture</h2>

	<p>Developed by <a href="http://www.audiogaming.net/">AudioGaming</a>, AudioTexture is a plugin prototype for sound texture synthesis that leverages Audio Commons by bringing CC-licensed audio content into the DAW. The AudioTexture plugin lets users generate sonic textures from audio recordings from either online or local databases within a DAW environment, such as Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, or Reaper.</p>

	<h3>Example 1: Rain</h3>

	<p><em>Coming soon...</em></p>

	<h3>Example 2: Footsteps</h3>

	<p><em>Coming soon...</em></p>

	<h3>Example 3: Crowd</h3>

	<p><em>Coming soon...</em></p>

	<h3>Example 4: Reshuffling a bass line</h3>

	<p><em>Coming soon...</em></p>

	<h2>SampleSurfer</h2>

	<p>SampleSurfer has been developed by <a href="https://www.waves.com/">Waves Audio LTD</a> and is another plugin for the ACE that serves as an audio content search engine based on semantic metadata and musical features. The plugin is designed to integrate Audio Commons sound and music samples in a DAW-based environment by providing basic editing capabilities (e.g. fades, trims) to optimize the music production workflow.</p>

	<h3>Example 1: Edited vs. original sound</h3>

	<p><em>Coming soon...</em></p>

	<h3>Example 2: Musical composition with edited loops</h3>

	<p><em>Coming soon...</em></p>

	<h2>Soundscape Composition</h2>

	<p>We provide here examples of short soundscape compositions that have been created in the Fall of 2017 by students from the Sound Recording and Production Techniques module at Queen Mary University of London led by Mathieu Barthet. The soundscape themes were found by applying and adapting the participatory design technique described in Holmquist (2008). Students were invited to generate ideas across four categories: character, place/environment, situation/action, and mood. These ideas were combined randomly and formed the basis of soundscape themes after a reflection and simplification phase. Students were given the creative constraint of only using sounds sourced from Audio Commons or Apple Loops. They could edit and process the sounds in the DAW and were able to use AudioGaming’s AudioTexture plugin to generate novel sonic textures from Audio Commons audio content.</p>

	<h3>Example 1 - Submerged by Andrew Thompson</h3>

		<p>Abstract: The piece, titled Submerged, is a short narrative that follows someone under immense pressure as they are plunged underwater in their dreams. Audio content in the composition was sourced either from Freesound.org or from the Apple Loops library and chosen to either directly reinforce the core concept or work to better realise the sonic space. Audio processing such as pitch shifting and chorus were applied, and mixing techniques such as utilising the Haas effect and binaural processing to provide space, clarity, and interest in the mix.	</p>

	<h3>Example 2 - “Space meal” by Andrea Guidi</h3>

	<p>Abstract: A woman doctor is in a rush and rapidly shares a meal in the space with a friend. She is so busy that she cannot relax and her smart devices continuously spread alerts
	concerning her work and less important things. In this context, her friend’s complaints
	do not receive much consideration. Thus, a metaphoric conversation between the
	woman doctor, her friend and her smart devices (through the sound alerts) happens
	during the soundscape. The doctor’s attention is overloaded both by notifications and
	by her friends complaints while the listener auditory experience is overloaded by the
	amplitude and presence of the sounds that describe the meal (cutleries and chewing).</p>

	<h3>Example 3 - “A camper and his dog in France” by Caryl Jones</h3>

	<p>Abstract: The resources for this composition solely included recorded sounds from Freesound, the concatenative synthesis plugin AudioTexture to treat some of these sounds and audio samples from Apple Loops. The digital audio workstation (DAW) used was Logic and Audio Technica headphones for monitoring. The compositional approach was to create a figurative piece with an abstract, dream-like edge of a man walking his dog in France from a first person perspective. Sounds were divided into five categories for the arrangement and laid out in a linear way to tell a story from morning to evening with quick transitions between natural summer scenes. Sounds were arranged and mixed using trim, volume, pan automation, gain and EQ. The composition was mastered using a limiter to stop clipping.</p>

	<h2>Live Coding</h2>

	 <p>MIRLC (Xambó et al. 2018) is a library designed to repurpose audio samples from Freesound, which can also be applied to local databases, by providing human-like queries and real-time performance capabilities. The system is built within the SuperCollider environment by leveraging the Freesound API.

	<h2>Play.sound</h2>

	<p>Playsound.space (Stolfi et al. 2018) is a web-based sound search and music creation tool providing access to online audio content from Audio Commons (Freesound). Playsound can be used in a varied range of contexts, from individual soundscape compositions to collaborative live music improvisations with laptop musicians.
		<a href="https://www.audiocommons.org/2018/06/01/nime-2018-playsound.html">The tool was presented at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression conference</a> at Virginia Tech in 2018.</p>

<h3>Example 1 - Demo with laptop trios</h3>

We used Playsound.space in the context of free live music improvisation in small ensembles.
The following video shows laptop trios composed of both non musicians and musicians who were able to play short pieces together after a brief introduction to the tool:</p>

<h3>Example 2 - Crowd Noises by The Puppets</h3>

<p>The following excerpt was produced during an improvisation involving a mixed ensemble of Playsound players and other instrumentalists.
The excerpt was in turn uploaded to Freesound forming an iterative creative loop between sound producers and consumers:</p>

<h3>Example 3 - Adaptation of Gertrude Stein's poem Tender Buttons by Ariane Stolfi</h3>

<p>Playsound.space was used by Ariane Stolfi to generate a sonic interpretation of Gertrude Stein's poem Tender Buttons. The performer used excerpts of the poem as the source for semantic searches to obtain Creative Commons audio content from illustrating the poem:</p>
